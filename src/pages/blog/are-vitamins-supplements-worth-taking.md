I'm personally a big fan of Vitamin D & Zinc whenever I feel run down or feel a cold coming. I was excited to see one of my favorite new podcasts, [Science Vs](https://gimletmedia.com/science-vs/) tackle this topic.

Here's a quick recap on what I took away from this episode:

* Vitamin D has virtually eradicated rickets.
* Vitamin D can help bone health but beyond that, the science is opinionated.
* Omega 3 is proven to help rats fight nerve damage, reduce brain inflammation & prevent Alzheimer's disease. Humans are not as easy to study.
* Calcium supplements are pretty much worthless.
* Multivitamins are probably worth little value for people eating healthy but appear to be safe to take as an insurance.
* Vitamin C & Zinc have evidence to decrease the length of a cold, but not prevent one.

A couple other items were interesting & informative. The history of vitamins was something I knew nothing of before. [Science Vs](https://gimletmedia.com/science-vs/) illustrates how hard studying human diets can be. From now on whenever I think of Vitamin D, I'll also start singing [Ludacris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xseqj9d7FsY)
