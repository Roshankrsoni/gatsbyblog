I've been skimming a lot of resources lately on learning Elixir. My preferred learning method is to build things immediately, while learning the syntax and finer details along the way. I've never been a fan spending hours learning the finer details & not having anything to show for it. If that's your preferred style of learning I suggest the following resources:

## Brand New to Elixir

If you haven't written any Elixir at all try these resources.

* [Take Off With Elixir](https://bigmachine.io/products/take-off-with-elixir/)
  * There is a free 30 minute preview which is one of the best explanations of the syntax I've seen. If you like it, you can even buy the full tutorial.
* [Code School Video Tutorials](https://www.codeschool.com/learn/elixir)
  * Has a free course, a free screencast & a paid course.

If you would rather learn the syntax first, try the [Official Getting Started Tutorial](http://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html).

## Updates
I'll add more advanced levels as my skills progress. If you have any suggestions please leave a comment below & I'll check it out.
