  AFFILIATE: `<p><strong>Pluralsight</strong><br />I'm constantly learning from a wide assortment of books & websites. The one subscription I never cancel though is Pluralsight. Their library is enormous & they have awesome learning paths that allow you to see how well you know your stuff. Check out my <a href="https://app.pluralsight.com/profile/mattferderer">Pluralsight profile to see what I'm learning &amp; how I rank</a>. If you're interested in giving them a try, they offer a <a href="https://pluralsight.pxf.io/c/1197267/424552/7490">10 day free trial</a>.</p>
  <p><strong>Brave</strong><br />For browsing the web, I highly recommend using the new <a href="https://brave.com/mat243">Brave web browser</a>. It's built using the same engine as Google Chrome but it blocks ads & protects your privacy. If you or your loved ones leave websites open all day, this browser is a must have.</p>
  <p>On occassion I do link to a product available on Amazon. As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.</p>`
