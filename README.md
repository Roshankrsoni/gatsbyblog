# Gatsby version of my site

This blog is in the early stages of development. A lot of code is copied & pasted from a Ghost blog I had setup. I'm transitioning that over to this blog. I plan on cleaning parts up & refactoring as I have time.

Most of the personalized content can be swapped in the `/src/constants.js` file.

## Credits

The webkid styles are originally from the [ghost-wbkd theme](https://github.com/wbkd/ghost-wbkd)

A lot of leftover Ghost CSS is included as well. I need to do a lot of tidying up.
